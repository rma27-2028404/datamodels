Cassandra

This is an Open-source database.
Cassandra uses a column-family data model.
Cassandra can be deployed in various hosting models, including self-hosted, cloud-based, or as a service.
Cassandra is a distributed NoSQL database management system designed to handle large amounts of data across many commodity servers, providing high availability with no single point of failure. Cassandra uses a column-family data model, which is different from the document and graph-based models discussed previously. In the column-family data model, data is stored in column families, which are containers for rows of data. Each row contains a unique key, and each column family can contain multiple columns. Unlike relational databases, where columns are predefined, in Cassandra, columns can be added dynamically. This flexibility allows for efficient and scalable storage of large amounts of data. Additionally, Cassandra's distributed architecture allows it to handle high write and read throughput, making it well-suited for use cases that require fast and scalable data storage and retrieval.
